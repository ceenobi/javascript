food = 20
tipPercent = 0.2
tipAmounts = food * tipPercent
console.log(tipAmounts)

//first js app excercise - calc user input
//using prompt()- a js functionality that user input through the browser

// foodAmount = Number(prompt('How much was the food?'))
// tipPercentage = Number(prompt('tip amount')) / 100
// tipAmount = foodAmount * tipPercentage
// totalBuy = foodAmount + tipAmount
// console.log('tipAmount', tipAmount)
// console.log('totalBuy', totalBuy)

//we can output the result to the screen also using alert which is the opposite of prompt
// alert(totalAmount)
//normally we do not use prompt to get user input in js, we use forms
//if we console.log(totalBuy) we would get a concate string as the result cos the prompt views the result as a string. To force it as a mumber we would wrap the food variable with the number function
//we can make the console output more descriptive by using the sting function as denoted up
